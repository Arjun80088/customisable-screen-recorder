        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Last updated:</strong> [Date]
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy applies to the Screen Recorder Extension ("the extension") and governs the privacy of its users who choose to use it.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or information. The functionality of the extension is limited to allowing users to record their screen based on their initiation. All recordings are saved locally on the user's device and are not accessed by the extension or any third parties.
        </p>
        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The extension requires the following permissions to function:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> This permission is necessary to interact with the currently active tab in the user's browser, allowing the extension to initiate the screen recording process.</li>
            <li><strong>scripting:</strong> This permission is required to inject and execute the screen recording script within the web pages of the active tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The extension does not use any third-party services for data collection, analytics, or any other purpose. All operations are conducted locally within the user's browser.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, and we encourage users to review the policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting their privacy.
        </p>
